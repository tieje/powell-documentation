To get the field name for an event type

1. Site Contents
2. Go to your Event type calendar list
3. Make an example event if you don't already have one.
4. Click on the example event.
5. In the top ribbon in the events tab, press the View Event button.
6. Right click on a field's association.
    - Ex. The field association of "Title: Grand Opening" is "Grand Opening".
7. Press Inspect on your browser's context menu.
8. The field name for the event type should be in the HTML as a comment after `FieldInternalName=`. Expand elements as needed. If you can't find it, you might have right-clicked the field instead of the field association. (It's such an insane design).
